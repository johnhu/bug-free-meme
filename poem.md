# The Oak
ðŸŒ³
#### *by ~~John Hu~~ Alfred Lord Tennyson*

_Live_ thy Life,\
Young and old,\
Like yon oak,\
Bright in spring,\
Living gold;\

Summer-rich\
Then; and then\
Autumn-changed\
Soberer-hued\
Gold again.\

All his leaves\
Fall'n at length,\
Look, he stands,\
Trunk and bough\
Naked strength.\
